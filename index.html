        <p>Originally Answered: What does the P symbol stand for?

If the P looks like a right facing triangular flag or semi circle part is set about a third of the way down from the top then it represents the elder futhark Nordic rune Thurisaz. It's representative sound is a soft “th”, as in Thor. You see it in Icelandic or Nordic writings most commonly. In fact it is quite common to see it in the name Thor with Thurisaz replacing the Th</p>
